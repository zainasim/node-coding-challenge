The design pattern I've followed in organizing this application structure into separate modules is generally referred to as the "Modular Design Pattern" in the context of NestJS. This pattern involves dividing the application into smaller, self-contained modules that encapsulate specific features or functionality.


**Steps to start app**
1) Run **npm install**
    this will install all dependencies
2) Run **npm run start:dev**
    this will start the server locally at port 3000
3) Go to **http://localhost:3000/swagger**
    this url will take you to swagger docs
